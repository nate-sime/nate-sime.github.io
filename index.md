### About

I am a researcher developing finite element methods, their implementation and
their application. I primarily work with the [FEniCS
project](https://fenicsproject.org/), both in its development and application.


### Research interests

Scientific computing, finite element methods,
automatic code generation, mathematical modelling, uncertainty quantification,
parallel computing for large scale problems, mathematics for asset valuation.


### Software

- [FEniCS project](https://fenicsproject.org/) ([on
  GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/FEniCS/repositories)): Generalised toolbox
  for computing the finite element approximation of solutions of partial
  differential equations.

- [dolfin_dg](https://github.com/nate-sime/dolfin_dg): Utilities and tools to
  complement [UFL](https://github.com/FEniCS/ufl) for the automated
  formulation of discontinuous Galerkin discretisations.

- [febug](https://github.com/nate-sime/febug): Debugging finite element
  problems in DOLFINx and utility functions for plotting FE data.

- [LEoPart](https://bitbucket.org/nate-sime/leopart): Particle functionality
  extension for FEniCS.

- [GeoPart](https://bitbucket.org/nate-sime/geopart): Utility functions for
  LEoPart facilitating discretisation of geodynamics models.

- [Mantle convection examples with
  DOLFINx](https://github.com/nate-sime/mantle-convection): A collection of
  finite element models related to mantle convection, including thermal driven
  buoyancy and subduction zone deformation.

- [Subduction zone forearc
  modelling](https://bitbucket.org/nate-sime/subduction-zone-forearc-thermal-structure):
  Thermal model of of subduction zone with internal friction.

- [DOLFINx-MPC](https://github.com/jorgensd/dolfinx_mpc): Extension of DOLFINx
  supporting scalable assembly of $$K^\top A K$$ systems for multi-point
  constraint (MPC) matrix $$K$$.
