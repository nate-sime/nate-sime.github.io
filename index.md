I am a researcher developing finite element methods, their implementation and
their application.

### Research interests:

Scientific computing, finite element methods, automatic code generation,
mathematical modelling, uncertainty quantification, parallel computing for
large scale problems, computational mathematics.



# Software

- [FEniCS project](https://fenicsproject.org/) ([on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/FEniCS/repositories)): Generalized toolbox for computing approximation of partial differential equation solutions by the finite element method.

- [dolfin_dg](https://github.com/nate-sime/dolfin_dg): Utilities and tools to complement [UFL](https://github.com/FEniCS/ufl) for the automated
formulation of discontinuous Galerkin discretisations.

- [DOLFINx-MPC](https://github.com/jorgensd/dolfinx_mpc): Extension of DOLFINx supporting assembly of $$K^\top A K$$ systems for multi-point
constraint (MPC) matrix $$K$$.

- [febug](https://github.com/nate-sime/febug): Debugging finite element problems in DOLFINx and
utility functions for plotting FE data.

- [LEoPart](https://bitbucket.org/nate-sime/leopart): Particle functionality extension for FEniCS.

- [GeoPart](https://bitbucket.org/nate-sime/geopart): Utility functions for LEoPart facilitating discretisation of geodynamics models.

- [Subduction zone forearc modelling](https://bitbucket.org/nate-sime/subduction-zone-forearc-thermal-structure): Thermal model of of subduction zone with internal friction.
